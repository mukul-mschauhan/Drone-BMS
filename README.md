# Drone Battery Management System (BMS) â€“ Prototype
## Overview

This repository contains a prototype implementation of a Battery Management System (BMS) for drones, built using a hybrid physics + ML approach. It demonstrates how simulated data can be used to bootstrap predictive models for flight time and battery consumption, and provides a Streamlit UI for real-time interaction. 

The goal is to evolve this prototype into a defense-grade mission-aware BMS that can reliably inform soldiers of remaining flight time, safe-to-land windows, and battery risk under varying environmental and mission conditions.
